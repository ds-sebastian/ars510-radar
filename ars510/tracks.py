"""Track IDs from the radar's own slot / age lifecycle.

An object keeps its slot while the radar tracks it and its age counts up by one per cycle (saturating at 126).
A new ID starts whenever a slot's age fails to increase (restart, age 0) or the slot goes quiet for longer than
`max_gap_s`. Checked on held-out drives: no duplicate IDs, and no radar identity error found within 60 m on
visual review. Beyond 60 m identity could not be verified. See docs/05_validation.md.
